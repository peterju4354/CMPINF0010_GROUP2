## Miscellany
We chose our Code of Conduct as it promotes a welcoming environment for people of all ages, sex, ethnicity, and more. We encourage contributors to be empathetic, kind, and respectful to maintain a positive and friendly community. Our Code of Conduct also enforces guidelines to warn and take action against violators.

We went with The Unliscence as we want our beautiful program to be blessed upon the hearts of every computer in the world (while maintaining our protection should any issues/liabilities occur).
